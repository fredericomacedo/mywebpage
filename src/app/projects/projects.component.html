          <p class="lead portfolio-description">VMS Blockchain System: Revolutionizing Vendor Management</p>
      
          <p>Introducing the VMS Blockchain System - an innovative solution designed to redefine the landscape of vendor management. 
            Harnessing the unparalleled security and transparency of blockchain, the system 
            guarantees authentic, immutable contracts, ensuring absolute trust in every 
            transaction. Developed using TypeScript and Angular, the front-end offers an 
            intuitive user experience while the backend, built with JavaScript and Express, 
            provides robustness via a RESTful API architecture. Following the MVC design pattern, 
            this system is not just an application, but a testament to merging traditional vendor 
            management with next-gen blockchain technology.  | Client: Algonquin College | collaboration: Daniel dos Santos Barboza

          <p>For Nokia, I spearheaded a full-stack web application complemented by a comprehensive 
            business analysis solution, focusing on streamlined internal project cost management. 
            This centralized system offers real-time expenditure tracking through intuitive 
            interfaces developed with CSS, JavaScript, and HTTP. PowerFX facilitated dynamic data 
            interactions, while SharePoint provided organized data storage. Power Automator, 
            seamlessly integrated, automated critical tasks like data imports and notifications, 
            ensuring both efficiency and precision. Securely hosted on Azure Environment, 
            the application ensures scalability and consistent performance. My holistic approach 
            not only digitalized Nokia's cost management but also empowered decision-makers with 
            immediate, accurate insights, thereby optimizing project budget allocation and overall 
            business strategy. May 2023.
