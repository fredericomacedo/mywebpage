          <p>👨🏻‍💻 Introducing the VMS Blockchain System - an innovative solution designed to redefine the landscape of vendor management. 
            Harnessing the unparalleled security and transparency of blockchain, the system 
            guarantees authentic, immutable contracts, ensuring absolute trust in every 
            transaction. Developed using TypeScript and Angular, the front-end offers an 
            intuitive user experience while the backend, built with JavaScript and Express, 
            provides robustness via a RESTful API architecture. Following the MVC design pattern, 
            this system is not just an application, but a testament to merging traditional vendor 
            management with next-gen blockchain technology.
